# Vue.js Resume Refactoring Plan - Next Steps

This document outlines the remaining steps for refactoring the existing resume repository into a modern Vue.js application, based on the comprehensive plan developed earlier.

## 1. Current Status

The initial setup of the Vue.js project and Tailwind CSS integration has been successfully completed.

* A new Vue.js project named `resume` has been scaffolded within the `vue-resume` directory using Vite.
* Vue Router, Pinia, Vitest, ESLint, and Prettier have been included in the project setup.
* Tailwind CSS has been installed and configured, and the PostCSS warnings have been resolved.
* All dependencies have been installed using `pnpm`.

## 2. Detailed Next Steps & Checklist

The following tasks are organized to guide the refactoring process, focusing on component development, data integration, and further enhancements.

### 2.1 Data Integration (Pinia Store)

* [ ] Create the `src/store` directory inside `vue-resume/resume`.
* [ ] Create `src/store/profile.js` to define the Pinia store for resume data.
* [ ] Import `data/profile.json` into `src/store/profile.js`.
* [ ] Define state, getters, and (if necessary) actions in the `profile` store to expose resume data.
* [ ] Integrate the Pinia store into the main Vue application (`src/main.js`).

### 2.2 Component Development

* [ ] **Review Existing Components:** Analyze the structure and content of the original Gatsby components (`src/components/*.js`).
* [ ] **Create Core Vue Components:**
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Header.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Summary.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Experience.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Education.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Skills.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Projects.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Contact.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Footer.vue`
* [ ] **Create Reusable Sub-Components:**
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/SocialIcon.vue`
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/ListItem.vue` (for experience, education, projects)
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Progress.vue` (for skill bars)
  * [ ] Create `vue-resume/resume/src/components/Publication.vue` (if applicable)
* [ ] **Populate Components with Data:**
  * [ ] Use the Pinia `profile` store to fetch and display data within each component.
  * [ ] Pass data down to child components using `props`.
* [ ] **Apply Tailwind CSS Styling:**
  * [ ] Replicate the styling from the original Gatsby project using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
  * [ ] Ensure responsiveness and visual consistency.

### 2.3 Application Structure & Routing

* [ ] **Update `App.vue`:**
  * [ ] Integrate the main resume components (`Header`, `Summary`, `Experience`, etc.) into `vue-resume/resume/src/App.vue`.
  * [ ] Implement smooth scrolling to sections using anchor links (if not using full Vue Router routes for sections).
* [ ] **Configure Vue Router (if multi-page sections are desired):**
  * [ ] Define routes for different sections (e.g., `/`, `/projects`, `/contact`).
  * [ ] Implement navigation links.

### 2.4 Asset Migration

* [ ] Migrate static assets (images, fonts) from `src/assets/` in the original repository to `vue-resume/resume/src/assets/`.
* [ ] Update component templates to reference the new asset paths.

### 2.5 Cleanup and Optimization

* [ ] Remove any unused default components or files generated by `create-vue` (e.g., `HelloWorld.vue`, `TheWelcome.vue`, `counter.js` store, `AboutView.vue`, `HomeView.vue`).
* [ ] Review and optimize CSS (if any custom CSS is added).
* [ ] Ensure proper ESLint and Prettier configuration for ongoing development.
* [ ] Consider adding basic unit tests for key components using Vitest.

## 3. Future Considerations

* **Deployment:** Plan for deploying the Vue.js application (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
* **SEO:** Implement meta tag management for SEO (e.g., using `vue-meta` or similar).
* **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible to all users.
* **Performance Optimization:** Further optimize loading times and rendering performance.
