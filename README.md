## Projects

### E-commerce Recommendation System | Changing.AI
We built a recommendation system for one of the top 3 e-commerce websites in Taiwan. The system uses Fluentd and ElasticSearch to collect real time log of user behavior. The data will be extracted, transformed and trained the Deep Learning recommendation engine automatically using Airflow. In order to deal with the massive loading of e-commerce websites, we use Kubernetes and Docker to deploy and auto-scale the server. Our system has increased the click-through rate and conversion rate by about 200%.

### E-commerce Search Engine | Changing.AI
We built an e-commerce search engine using ElasticSearch and Bert Deep Learning model. Our Engine reduces errors by more than 40%.

### ChatGPT Chrome Extension | Personal side project
[GitHub](https://github.com/PuChenTW/gpt-extension)

This is a Google Chrome extension that provides a quick and easy way to check the grammar of text on websites. Users can also define their own prompts in the options page to let the extension do other tasks, such as code review or creating an abstract for the article.
